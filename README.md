## Exercise: Music Playlist with Shuffle and Repeat using LinkedList in Java

#### Objective:

The objective of this exercise is to create a music playlist management system with shuffle and repeat functionality using a LinkedList in Java. You will model the process of adding songs to a playlist, shuffling the playlist, repeating songs, and displaying the playlist.

#### Scenario: Music Playlist Management

Imagine you are building a program to manage a music playlist. Users can add songs to the playlist, shuffle the playlist, repeat songs, and view the list of songs. You will implement this functionality using a LinkedList.

#### Guidelines:

1. Create a class named Song with the following attributes:
    - String title: to store the title of the song.
    - String artist: to store the artist's name.
3. Create a class named MusicPlaylist that includes the following methods:
    - void addSong that adds a new song with the given title and artist to the LinkedList.
    - void shufflePlaylist that shuffles the order of songs in the playlist.
    - void repeatPlaylist that repeats the playlist by the specified number of times.
    - void displayPlaylist that displays the details of all songs in the playlist.
4. Create instances of the MusicPlaylist class and multiple instances of the Song class in the main method.
5. Add songs to the playlist, shuffle the playlist, repeat the playlist, and display the playlist.
